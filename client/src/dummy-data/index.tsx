Later called Plaza del Mercado (Market Square) as Havanas commercial hub, Plaza Vieja was the site of executions, processions, bullfights, and fiestas -- all witnessed by Havanas wealthiest citizens, who looked on from their balconies. The original Carrara marble fountain surrounded by four dolphins was demolished in the 1930s when President Gerardo Machado (1871-1939) built an underground parking lot here. Today the squares surrounding structures vary wildly in condition, though all of them are noteworthy.'
